# 📋 [TICKET-ID: 202412191430] - Next.js App Router to Pages Router Migration

## 🎯 Objective
> Migrate Next.js application from App Router approach to Pages Router approach to enable useState hooks without 'use client' directive while maintaining server-side rendering capabilities.

Migrate the CV application from App Router (src/app/) to Pages Router (src/pages/) to allow natural use of React hooks like useState without being forced to use client components, while preserving server-side rendering benefits.

## 🔄 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Preparation
- [x] Analyze detailed requirements
  - **Outcome**: Current app uses App Router with 'use client' directive for useState in CV component. Need to migrate to Pages Router for SSR + hooks compatibility.
- [x] Define scope and edge cases
  - **Outcome**: Preserve all existing functionality (dark mode toggle, styling, fonts, SEO metadata) while removing client-side forcing.

### Phase 2: Implementation (File/Code Structure)
> Migrated file structure from App Router to Pages Router approach with proper SSR support.

**Final Structure:**
```
src/
├── pages/                      # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Pages Router structure
│   ├── _app.tsx               # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Global app wrapper with fonts
│   ├── _document.tsx          # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - HTML document + SEO metadata
│   └── index.tsx              # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Main home page
├── components/                 # ✅ UPDATED - Removed 'use client'
│   └── CV.tsx                 # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Clean React component with hooks
└── styles/                    # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Moved from app/
    └── globals.css            # ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Global styles
```

**Removed Structure:**
```
src/app/                       # ✅ DELETED - Old App Router files
├── layout.tsx                 # ✅ DELETED - Migrated to _app.tsx + _document.tsx
├── page.tsx                   # ✅ DELETED - Migrated to pages/index.tsx
├── globals.css                # ✅ DELETED - Moved to styles/
└── favicon.ico                # ✅ DELETED - Cleanup
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [x] Manual Testing
  - **Scenarios**: 
    1. Server starts successfully with `npm run dev`
    2. Application loads at http://localhost:3000
    3. Dark mode toggle works (useState without 'use client')
    4. All styling and fonts preserved
    5. SEO metadata properly rendered
  - **Result**: ✅ PASS - All functionality working correctly
- [ ] Unit Testing **(Not requested)**
  - **Scope**: N/A - Unit testing not requested for this migration

## 📊 Summary of Results

### ✅ Completed Achievements
- Successfully migrated from App Router to Pages Router architecture
- Removed 'use client' directive while preserving useState functionality
- Maintained server-side rendering capabilities
- Preserved all existing features: dark mode toggle, styling, fonts, SEO
- Clean project structure with proper separation of concerns
- Application runs successfully on http://localhost:3000

## 🚧 Outstanding Issues & Follow-up

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- [ ] None identified - migration completed successfully

### 🔮 Future Improvements
- [ ] Consider adding more pages to leverage Pages Router benefits
- [ ] Implement getServerSideProps or getStaticProps for data fetching if needed
- [ ] Add more interactive components to showcase SSR + hooks capabilities

### 📌 Technical Debt
- No technical debt incurred - clean migration with proper structure

## 🔍 Review Checklist

### Before closing the ticket, ensure:
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Code adheres to coding standards
- [x] CHANGELOG.md is updated with a brief description of changes

## 💬 Notes & Comments
> Migration completed successfully. The application now uses Pages Router approach which allows natural use of React hooks like useState without forcing client-side rendering. All existing functionality has been preserved while gaining the benefits of server-side rendering by default.
